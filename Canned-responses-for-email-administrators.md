**Cheat -> False positive apology**
>After investigating you case, we have determined that our cheat detection algorithms flagged your account due to a false positive. We are continuously improving our cheat detection so that we can aggressively prevent cheating while minimizing the false positives. We apologize for the inconvenience, and have now removed the flag on your account.

**Email -> GMail dots**
>For GMail accounts, dots in the email address doesn't actually make any difference. "foobar@gmail.com", "foo.bar@gmail.com" and "f.o.o.b.a.r@gmail.com" are all the same.
