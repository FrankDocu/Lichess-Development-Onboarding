# Your job as a moderator
As a moderator it is your job to keep the peace in lichess. Most of your time will be spent handling user reports; on average in a 24 hour period there will be no more than 20 reports. Most often these reports concern cheating, or unfriendly behaviour (trolling). The rest of your time moderating lichess can be spent looking after the forum; closing rampant discussions, and removing abusive posts (spam, "just testing the captcha!", insults, and whatnot), or going on a good ole' cheater hunt!

For the rest of the time you are free to do what you like, but remember, _you represent lichess_.

## It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.
Now for the perks. To assist you in moderating lichess, and especially investigating cheaters, there are a few tools.

Firstly you will notice that when clicking on your name on the top right of the screen, there are 3 additional menu options: Staff Forum, Mod Log, and User Reports.

### The Staff Forum
The Staff Forum is a private forum that can be used to discuss private moderator business. Most discussions that happen here revolve around features that can be added to make moderating lichess easier, and 'fringe cases' where one moderator cannot determine if a player is cheating or not.
