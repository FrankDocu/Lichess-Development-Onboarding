# Your job as a moderator
As a moderator, it is your job to keep the peace in lichess. Most of your time will be spent handling user reports; on average in a 24 hour period there will be no more than 20 reports. Most often these reports concern cheating, or unfriendly behaviour (trolling). The rest of your time moderating lichess can be spent looking after the forum; closing rampant discussions, and removing abusive posts (spam, "just testing the captcha!", insults, and whatnot), or going on a good ole' cheater hunt!

For the rest of the time you are free to do what you like, but remember, _you represent lichess_.

## It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.
Now for the perks. To assist you in moderating lichess, and especially investigating cheaters, there are a few tools.

Firstly you will notice that when clicking on your name on the top right of the screen, there are 3 additional menu options: Staff Forum, Mod Log, and User Reports.

### Staff Forum
The Staff Forum is a private forum that can be used to discuss private moderator business. Most discussions that happen here revolve around features that can be added to make moderating lichess easier, and _fringe cases_ where one moderator cannot determine if a player is cheating or not.

### Mod[erator] Log
This page has a summary of all the moderator level actions that other moderators have carried out, i.e. marking a player and an engine, mark as troll, closing forum topics, and so on...

### User Reports
This is where all reports that users generate through the [report page](http://en.lichess.org/report) appear. The first column is who created the report, second is who is being accused, and the final column is a description. Once you have taken care of a report, press the large "check" button to mark the report as checked.

Currently only Thibault can investigate abuse that took place via inbox messages, so leave these unchecked for now.

However, you *can* check abuse that happened through game chats by asking people to copy and paste the chat to you. This entails privately-messaging the reporter first, and some mods are not keen on revealing their identities.

## Cheater Hunting
When it comes to determining if a player is cheating, there is an arsenal of tools at your disposal. 

### Indicators of a Cheater
There are 3 key indicators that a player is cheating in any particular game:

1. Very few errors in computer analysis. This is the first sign of a cheater, but not the most incriminating - anyone can have a couple of good games.
2. High _blur_ percentage. 'What does that mean?' I hear you ask, good question. When a player leaves the current game window and _focuses_ on another application, they trigger a _blur_ event and this is captured by lichess. We cannot see what they turn their attention to; it might be a conversation with a friend, but it might also be a chess-engine that they are using. When this percentage starts to move over 90% you can be fairly confident that they are using a chess-engine to assist them. Some players can bypass the blur-tracking system completely, though this is usually not intentional.
3. A *flat move-time graph*. The pie chart will also have a very large slice of 6-9 seconds or above. If a player is using an engine to determine their moves, they will generally make all their moves in a consistent amount of time as they are not thinking for themselves. A normal player will usually move quickly during the opening because they are familiar with the lines that are being played, then slow down in the middle game, but still make some moves very snappily (such as moving out of check). Note that in endgames, when there are 3 or 4 pieces on the board, most people stop using engines.

### Searching for Incriminating Games
To make it easier to find if a player has cheated, there's a button on the moderator page that searches for and sorts games based upon the above known indicators. In the moderator section of a user's page, press the 'Evaluate' button, and a list of games will appear as well as an overall assessment of the player. A player who scores above ~85% after a thorough scan is almost definitely cheating, below that mark will require some investigation.

### You've found a cheater, now what?
Once you have determined if a player is cheating, press the 'Mark as Engine' button on their account, this will make other players aware that this players uses computer analysis, and will reset their rating to the default 1500 rating.

If the player has cheated 1 or more times in the past, we also enforce an 'IP ban' which stops them from using registered accounts in the future. The only exception to this is if there are other accounts related to the cheating account that are legitimate players - however if these accounts are inactive, IP banning can be enforced.

## Moderating The Forum
Moderating the forum is simple. If someone posts something heinous, offensive, or plain old pointless to the forum, just delete their post. Using your better judgement you can also mark them as a _troll_ via the moderator panel on the user's page.

If you've come to the conclusion that a thread of the forum has turned rampant and off topic, you can close the thread via the 'close the topic' at the bottom of the thread.
