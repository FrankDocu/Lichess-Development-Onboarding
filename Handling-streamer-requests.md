When it comes to featured streams, we want quality over quantity. We don't aim at bootstrapping new streamers. Like [Twitch partnership](https://www.twitch.tv/partner/signup), excellence is a prerequisite. 

Established streamers with good reputation can be added right away.

Excellent players, IMs, and GMs, can be added right away, even without streaming history. Then try and checkout their first featured stream to ensure the technical quality is here.

Streamers that are neither popular nor excellent players should be avoided.

If their lichess rating is under 2300, ask them to improve their chess.
If they don't have a streamer reputation yet, ask them to build it first.

We have too much demand, therefore we're picky.
