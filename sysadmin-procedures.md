## restart lichess

`systemctl restart lichess`

## when hooks pile up, slowing down the server

-> restart lichess

## reading debug logs

`tail -20 lichessjournal`  
Replace 20 with the line count to display desired. The log file is sometimes very large (`wc -l lichessjournal`) so it's probably better to only print the last bulk of it.
