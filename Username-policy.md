If a username is deemed inappropriate, the user account should be closed. Adding a shadowban before closing the account, will ensure that the email address can't be used to create a new account.

In general, **a username chosen with the intent of generating negative emotional reactions**, is bad. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Usernames with highly offensive/sensitive topics, e.g. race, gender, sexuality
* Usernames with sexual references
* Usernames that are disparaging towards others
* Usernames impersonating living people (impersonating means that you can reasonably mistaken for someone you are not)
* Usernames advertising websites that are unrelated to chess. Chess websites are always ok to mention.

Moderators will always be able to use their judgement to override these rules.
