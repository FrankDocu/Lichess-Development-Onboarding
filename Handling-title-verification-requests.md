In order for a Lichess user account to be given a FIDE or NM title, the user must fill out the title verification form on https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd64rDqXOihJzPlBsQba75di5ioL-WMFhkInS2_vhVTvDtBag/viewform (now also requiring a selfie with the identity document). All title requests should be funneled into this form.

When the provided information is verified, the correct title can be set by a Lichess moderator and the player will be informed automatically by email. If the request is rejected, the user has to be informed manually.

For Russian national titles, we set NM for:
1) Russian national GM title "ГР"
2) Russian NM title "MC", aka Master of Sport (2400+ for men, 2200+ for women)
We do not set NM for the Russian national KMC.

For Czech national titles, we set NM for:
1) Czech national MC title, "mistr"/"mistryně" (2300+ ELO for men, 2100+ ELO for women)
We do not set NM for the Czech national KM title, "kandidát mistra"/"kandidátka mistryně" (2100+ for men, 1950+ for women)

For Indonesian national titles, use [this lookup](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HLh1nJnd0ryrsVABJvJNg6RzF8ODgyzHO1KZH5Y6_4k/edit). Only "MN" merits an NM lichess title.

For Canadian national titles, we set (W)NM only for the Canadian (W)NM title. http://chess.ca/titleholders
