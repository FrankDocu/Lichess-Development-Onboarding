In order for a Lichess user account to be given a FIDE or NM title, the user must fill out the title verification form on https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd64rDqXOihJzPlBsQba75di5ioL-WMFhkInS2_vhVTvDtBag/viewform (now also requiring a selfie with the identity document). All title requests should be funneled into this form.

When the provided information is verified, the correct title can be set by a Lichess moderator and the player will be informed automatically by email. If the request is rejected, the user has to be informed manually.
