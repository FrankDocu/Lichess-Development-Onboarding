In order for a Lichess user account to be given a FIDE title, the user must provide evidence of their identity in one of the following ways:

1. Send a scan/photo of their ID card, driving license, or similar ID to support@lichess.org
1. Send a message from an account with a verified title on chess.com to https://www.chess.com/member/ornicar

When given sufficient evidence, the correct title can be set by a Lichess moderator and the player can be informed by email.
