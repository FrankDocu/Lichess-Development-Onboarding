In order for a Lichess user account to be given a FIDE or NM title, the user must fill out the title verification form on https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd64rDqXOihJzPlBsQba75di5ioL-WMFhkInS2_vhVTvDtBag/viewform (now also requiring a selfie with the identity document). All title requests should be funneled into this form.

When the provided information is verified, the correct title can be set by a Lichess moderator and the player will be informed automatically by email. If the request is rejected, the user has to be informed manually.

For Russian national titles, we give NM only for the MC title (aka Master of Sport).
