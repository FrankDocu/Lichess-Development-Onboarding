The purpose of handling these reports is to prevent offensive and annoying behavior by Lichess users.

## Offensive communication

When handling reports of offensive communication, the goal is to determine whether the user should be shadowbanned or not. Someone who has been (and is likely to continue to be) offensive towards other users, should have their communication privileges revoked. Unless the username itself is offensive, it is better to shadowban than to close accounts, since the latter is likely to result in the offender quickly creating a new account.

These are some principles to follow when reviewing user communication (public chats, game chats, messages):

**More likely to take action**
* Many infractions (user displays a pattern)
* Highly offensive/sensitive topics, e.g. race, gender, sexuality (indicating intent to shock)
* Direct attacks on other users
* User was not provoked

**Less likely to take action**
* Single infraction (user doesn't display a pattern)
* Targets themselves, e.g. "fuck me", "i'm so stupid"
* Apologetic behavior
* User was provoked
* Banter with friends

## Intentionally leaving games or stalling on time

Some players will let the time run out, or outright quit an ongoing chess game instead of playing it to the end or resigning. This is not strictly forbidden, but excessive and repeated should be prevented. If there is good evidence for this type of behavior, it is advisable to warn the user and make a note on that user account. If the player continues the behavior, consider closing their account.

**More likely to take action**
* Many infractions
* Already warned
* Presence of communication substantiating an intent to annoy

**Less likely to take action**
* Few infractions, anyone can get an important phone call, lose their internet connection, etc.
