The purpose of handling these reports is to prevent offensive and annoying behavior by Lichess users.

## Offensive communication

When handling reports of offensive communication, the goal is to determine whether the user should be shadowbanned or not. Someone who has been (and is likely to continue to be) offensive towards other users, should have their communication privileges revoked. Unless the username itself is offensive, it is better to shadowban than to close accounts, since the latter is likely to result in the offender quickly creating a new account.

These are some principles to follow when reviewing user communication (public chats, game chats, messages):

More likely to take action
* Multiple/repeated infractions (user displays a pattern)
* Highly offensive/sensitive topics, e.g. race, gender, sexuality (indicating intent to shock)
* Direct attacks on other users
* User was not provoked

Less likely to take action
* Single infraction (user doesn't display a pattern)
* Targets themselves, e.g. "fuck me", "i'm so stupid"
* Apologetic behavior
* User was provoked
* Banter with friends
