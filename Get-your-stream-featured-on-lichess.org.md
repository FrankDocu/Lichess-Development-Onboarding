Are you streaming chess games on [twitch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv/)? Get featured on lichess.org and boost your traffic!
Lichess can detect when your stream is on air, and automatically show it on its homepage.

### Approval process
In order to ensure excellent TV quality, we are very picky in our choice of streamers.
We expect great chess level (comparable to http://www.twitch.tv/amazingoid) and/or entertainment potential (like http://www.twitch.tv/chesswhiz). Of course we don't want you to be like these guys: be unique. But if your stream is not in par in terms of educational or entertainment value, it probably won't cut it.
Also, video and sound quality must be good, and you should be comfortable with the streaming tools.
Talking is a must, using a camera is a plus.
When you think you are ready, just drop me a message at http://en.lichess.org/inbox/new?user=thibault to show me a stream you made.

### Set up with twitch.tv

Add "lichess.org" to your broadcast title. To edit your title, go to your channel page and click the "Edit" button underneath the title.

Something along the line of "Episode 3: rocking the blitz tourney on lichess.org" would do.

Please remove "lichess.org" from the title when you're not streaming games from the website.

### Is that it?

Yes. Lichess searches for the keyword "lichess.org" on theses sites every 10 seconds. As soon as a live stream is found, it is displayed right away on http://lichess.org for everyone to join and watch.

Happy streaming!
