Are you streaming chess games on twitch.tv or ustream.tv? Get featured on lichess.org and boost your traffic!
Lichess can detect when your stream is on air, and automatically show it on its homepage.

Actually twitch.tv and ustream.tv are supported; we recommend using twitch.tv.

### Set up with twitch.tv

Add "lichess.org" to your stream title.
Something along the line of "Episode 3: rocking the blitz tourney on lichess.org" would do.

### Set up with ustreamt.tv

Add "lichess.org" to your channel title. Because renamming an existing channel is quite a big deal, you may want to create a new channel for streaming only games played on lichess.
Something like "MyName on lichess.org" would do.

### Is that it?

Yes. Lichess searches for the keyword "lichess.org" on theses sites every 5 seconds. As soon as a live stream is found, it is displayed right on http://lichess.org for everyone to join and watch.

Happy streaming!
