Are you streaming chess games on [twitch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv/) or [Ustream](http://www.ustream.tv/)? Get featured on lichess.org and boost your traffic!
Lichess can detect when your stream is on air, and automatically show it on its homepage.

Both twitch.tv and Ustream are supported; twitch.tv is recommended for technical reasons.

### Set up with twitch.tv

Add "lichess.org" to your broadcast title. To edit your title, go to your channel page and click the "Edit" button underneath the title.

Something along the line of "Episode 3: rocking the blitz tourney on lichess.org" would do.

Please remove "lichess.org" from the title when you're not streaming games from the website.

### Set up with Ustream

Prepend "lichess.org" to your channel description. The description **must start with** "lichess.org" or ustream API won't find it. There's nothing we can do about it, and it's the reason why we recommend twitch.tv over ustream.tv.

Please remove "lichess.org" from the description when you're not streaming games from the website.


### Is that it?

Yes. Lichess searches for the keyword "lichess.org" on theses sites every 5 seconds. As soon as a live stream is found, it is displayed right away on http://lichess.org for everyone to join and watch.

Happy streaming!
