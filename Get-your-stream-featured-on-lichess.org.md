Are you streaming chess games on [twitch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv/) or [Ustream](http://www.ustream.tv/)? Get featured on lichess.org and boost your traffic!
Lichess can detect when your stream is on air, and automatically show it on its homepage.

Both twitch.tv and Ustream are supported; twitch.tv is recommended for technical reasons.

### Set up with twitch.tv

Add "lichess.org" to your broadcast title. To edit your title, go to your channel page and click the "Edit" button underneath the title.

Something along the line of "Episode 3: rocking the blitz tourney on lichess.org" would do.

Please remove "lichess.org" from the title when you're not streaming games from the website.

### Set up with Ustream

Add "lichess.org" to your channel title (not description).

Renaming an existing channel will not work. You _have_ to create a new channel for streaming only games played on lichess. You can create a new channel [http://www.ustream.tv/manage-show](here).

Something like "MyName on lichess.org" will do.

### Is that it?

Yes. Lichess searches for the keyword "lichess.org" on theses sites every 5 seconds. As soon as a live stream is found, it is displayed right away on http://lichess.org for everyone to join and watch.

Happy streaming!
