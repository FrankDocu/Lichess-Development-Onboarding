Are you streaming chess games on [twitch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv/) or [Ustream](http://www.ustream.tv/)? Get featured on lichess.org and boost your traffic!
Lichess can detect when your stream is on air, and automatically show it on its homepage.

Both twitch.tv and Ustream are supported; we recommend using twitch.tv for technical reasons.

### Set up with twitch.tv

Add "lichess.org" to your stream title.
Something along the line of "Episode 3: rocking the blitz tourney on lichess.org" would do.

### Set up with Ustream

Add "lichess.org" to your channel title (not description). Renaming an existing channel will not work. You would have to create a new channel for streaming only games played on lichess.
Something like "MyName on lichess.org" would do.

### Is that it?

Yes. Lichess searches for the keyword "lichess.org" on theses sites every 5 seconds. As soon as a live stream is found, it is displayed right away on http://lichess.org for everyone to join and watch.

Happy streaming!
