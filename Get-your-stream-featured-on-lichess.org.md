Are you streaming chess games on [twitch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv/) or [Ustream](http://www.ustream.tv/)? Get featured on lichess.org and boost your traffic!
Lichess can detect when your stream is on air, and automatically show it on its homepage.

### Approval process
It's quite easy. Drop me a message at http://en.lichess.org/inbox/new?user=thibault so show me a stream you made. I'll add you to the streamers whitelist ASAP.

### Set up with twitch.tv

Add "lichess.org" to your broadcast title. To edit your title, go to your channel page and click the "Edit" button underneath the title.

Something along the line of "Episode 3: rocking the blitz tourney on lichess.org" would do.

Please remove "lichess.org" from the title when you're not streaming games from the website.

### Is that it?

Yes. Lichess searches for the keyword "lichess.org" on theses sites every 10 seconds. As soon as a live stream is found, it is displayed right away on http://lichess.org for everyone to join and watch.

Happy streaming!
