Lichess users can apply to be listed on https://lichess.org/coach which is a curated list of the best online chess coaches. Being on the list can be seen as an endorsement, so users must go through an approval process before being added.

In order to apply, the user should send an application to contact@lichess.org.

These are the requirements that must be fulfilled for a user to be added to the curated list:
* The user must have verified NM or FIDE title on Lichess (see [Handling title verification requests](Handling-title-verification-requests)) - FIDE Trainer title is also valid
* The user must have experience with chess coaching in an online environment

When the requirements are fulfilled and if the applicant is approved, the user should be given the ROLE_COACH role and informed. The user can then edit their coach page on https://lichess.org/coach/edit
